# Amendment to the third submission
I added two changes based on the feedback to solve two issues that were raised in the second review.

This leaves me with one final problem where the project is flawed

Task 3/8:

1. I am asked to create users and groups.
2. While being logged as one user, I shall start log into a cloudtrail
3. I shall download from that cloudtrail that starts with creating the users and groups. However the cloudtrail is created AFTER the users are created.
4. I shall download it as csv, although it is per default stored as JSON.

Already two mentors did not acknowledge the flaw of this exercise.

I cannot make a newly create cloudtrail time travel back. Yes, I can delete users and recreate them again. I can also create a different different cloud trail, run the exercise and extract that log from a different cloudtrail. The standard of logging into cloudtrail is json. So also asking for CSV does not make sense.

With a workaround, everything is possible. But fact is that this exercise is broken and this should be adjusted. Because this exercise simply does not make sense.
